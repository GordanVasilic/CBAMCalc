"General information"
"Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ?CBAM Regulation?) to address greenhouse gas emissions embedded in certain goods ('CBAM goods': iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, hydrogen and electricity) on their importation into the customs territory of the European Union (the EU). The Regulation can be downloaded from:"
"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/956/oj"
"Pursuant to Article 35(7) of the Regulation, the Commission adopted an implementing act which lays down the detailed rules for 'reporting declarants' (as defined in Article 2(1) of this implementing act) for reporting obligations upon import into the European Union during the transitional period from 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2025 (?transitional period?). The Regulation can be downloaded from:"
"https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-08/C_2023_5512_1_EN_ACT_part1_v6.pdf"
"Article 8 of the implementing act requires reporting declarants to submit a CBAM report for each good listed under 1. imported into the EU. CBAM reports must contain certain data and information on the embedded emissions of the goods, to be obtained from the producer of these goods ('operators of installations located in third countries')."
"This data collection template has been developed on behalf of the Commission by its consultants (Umweltbundesamt GmbH Austria) and serves the purpose of facilitating the communication between operators of installations located in third countries and the reporting declarants."
"The views expressed in this file represent the views of the authors and not necessarily those of the European Commission. "
"This is the 2nd published version of the CBAM template, version of 23 October 2023."
"How to use this file"
"Automatic calculation (to be found in the menu Formula/Calculation options) must be turned on."
"It is recommended that you go through the file from start to end. There are a few functions which will guide you through the form which depend on previous input, such as cells changing colour if an input is not needed (see colour codes below)."
"Whenever a value of zero is to be reported, it should be entered rather than keeping the cell empty. Values needed for calculations should always be entered (especially if zero, because some formulas don't give results as long as required cells are empty). If a cell is kept empty, the reporting declarant do not know if the value is zero, is irrelevant or unknown, or if making entries has been overlooked."
"In several fields you can choose from predefined inputs using a ""drop-down list"", by either clicking on the small arrow appearing at the right border of the cell, or pressing ""Alt-CursorDown"" when you have selected the cell. Also, there are some fields which enable you to draft your reply even if a drop-down list exists. This is the case when drop-down lists contain empty list entries."
"Error messages will occur sometimes when data entries are incomplete. However, the non-appearance of error messages is not a guarantee for correct calculations, as a data completeness test is not always possible. If no result appears in a green field, it can be assumed that some data is still missing."
"Special care must be taken of ensure consistency of data with the units displayed."
"Colour codes and fonts:"
"Black bold text:"
"This is text describing the input required."
"Smaller italic text:"
"This text gives further explanations. "
"Yellow fields indicate mandatory inputs for the calculation of embedded emissions and for other information required."
"Light yellow fields indicate that an input is optional."
"Green fields show automatically calculated results. Red text indicates error messages (missing data etc)."
"Shaded fields indicate that an input in another field makes the input here irrelevant."
"Light grey areas are dedicated for navigation and hyperlinks."
"Additionally, there are colour indicators in some sheets (e.g. D, E) indicating the following:"
"White indicates that data entry is not required here, based on entries in another field making inputs here irrelevant (see 'shaded fields' above)."
"Red colour indicates data inputs are required but the relevant cells are empty or filled incorrectly."
"Green colour indicates data inputs are required and cells have been filled correctly."
"Navigation panels on top of each sheet provide hyperlinks for quick jumps to individual input sections. The first line (""Table of contents"", ""Further guidance"", ""Summary_Processes"" and ""Summary_Products"") is the same for all sheets. Depending on the sheet, further menu items are added. If the background colour of one of the hyperlink areas turns red, this indicates that data is missing in the related section (not in all sheets)."
"This template has been locked against data entry except for (light) yellow fields. However, for transparency reasons, no password has been set. This allows for complete viewing of all formulae. When using this file for data entry, it is recommended to keep the protection in force. The sheets should only be unprotected for checking the validity of formulae. It is recommended to do this in a separate file."
"In order to protect formulae against unintended modifications, which usually lead to wrong and misleading results, it is of utmost importance NOT TO USE the CUT & PASTE feature. If you want to move data, first COPY and PASTE them, and thereafter delete the unwanted data in the old (wrong) place."
"DISCLAIMER: All formulae have been developed carefully and thoroughly. However, mistakes cannot be fully excluded.
As described above, full transparency for checking the validity of calculations is ensured. Neither the authors of this file nor the European Commission can be held liable for eventual damages resulting from wrong or misleading results of the provided calculations. 
It is the full responsibility of the user of this file (i.e. the operator of an installation) to ensure that reporting declarants report accurate data."

"Sheet ""G_FurtherGuidance"" - Further guidance on specific sections in this template"
"General guidance"
"Each section of this template contains guidance on how to complete the required inputs in that section. However, for some sections the amount of guidance needed could distract the user from relevant inputs and make the format of the template less user-friendly. Where this is the case, the sections below provide the said further detailed guidance."
"You do however not have to read the sections below from top to bottom. It is better if you go through the template from start to end (as also recommended in sheet ""b_Guidelines&Conditions"") and relevant sections will contain a hyperlink that will direct you to the relevant guidance in this sheet anyway."
"You can also find further guidance, including examples, in the guidance document published on the European Commission's website, which can be found here:"
"In sheet ""B_EmInst"" the energy content and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated for each source stream and emission source."
"At the top of each block in that sheet you can find examples on how to complete data inputs in order to calculate the corresponding emissions for each source stream and emission source."
"Guidance on each parameter below aims to help you with filling all input fields in sheet ""B_EmInst""."
"Source streams (excluding PFC emissions)"
"Please select from the drop-down list the monitoring method applied for the relevant source stream: ""combustion"", ""process emissions"" or ""mass balance""."
"Please enter here the name of the source stream, e.g. coal, natural gas, clinker raw meal, limestone, iron ore, steel, scrap iron, scrap aluminium."
"Activity data (AD)"
"The activity data is the data on the amount of fuels or materials consumed or produced by a process as relevant for the calculation-based monitoring methodology, expressed mass in tonnes (t), or for gases as volume in normal cubic metres (Nm?), as appropriate."
"AD unit"
"The corresponding units in which the amounts above are provided. For example tonnes (t) for mass or normal cubic metres (Nm?) for gases."
"(prelim) EF"
"The ""preliminary"" emission factor is the assumed total emission factor of a mixed fuel or material based on the total carbon content composed of biomass fraction and fossil fraction before multiplying it with the fossil fraction to result in the emission factor."
"The net calorific value is the specific amount of energy released as heat when a fuel or material undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions less the heat of vaporisation of any water formed"
"Oxidation factor: the ratio of carbon oxidised to CO2 as a consequence of combustion to the total carbon contained in the fuel, expressed as a fraction, considering carbon monoxide (CO) emitted to the atmosphere as the molar equivalent amount of CO2."
"Conversion factor: the ratio of carbon emitted as CO2 to the total carbon contained in the source stream before the emitting process takes place, expressed as a fraction, considering CO emitted to the atmosphere as the molar equivalent amount of CO2."
"CarbC"
"The carbon content of the fuel or material."
"BioC"
"The biomass fraction is the ratio of carbon stemming from biomass to the total carbon content of a fuel or material, expressed as percentage."
"Further columns greyed out"
"Further columns are relevant for PFC emissions or emission sources (measurement-based approaches), but not for source streams. For source streams they are therefore greyed out."

"Applicable elements"
"Please select here whether measurable heat (e.g. steam) or waste gases are imported to or exported from the relevant production process. The relevance of indirect emissions from electricity are shown automatically here."
"Waste gases are particularly relevant in integrated iron & steel production and include flue gases containing high concentrations of incompletely oxidised carbon, for example, any coke oven gas imported into the blast furnace, or blast furnace gas exported from the production process to produce electricity."
"g)"
"DirEm*"
"Please include here all emissions directly linked to and therefore attributable to the production process taking into consideration the further provisions below."
"Avoidance of double counting"
"Emissions shall only be attributed to ONE production process reported for this installation. Values entered here must therefore NOT include any emissions of the precursors that have been selected as another 'production process' as otherwise the template would double-count the embedded emissions."
"Measureable heat (e.g. steam): Emissions associated with fuel input into boilers can be either included here or via the 'import of measurable heat' below, but must not be reported twice. In the case the heat is produced in a CHP, the emissions have to be split between heat and electricity. The CHP Tool can help with that:"
"Waste gases: special rules apply here. Emissions from waste gases produced in another production process and consumed in this process should NOT be reported under DirEm*, but under 'Waste gas imported' below."
"Emissions from waste gases produced in the production process, but exported for combustion outside the production process MUST be included here. The corresponding deduction of emissions will be done by entering the relevant data under 'waste gas exported' below. An example would be the export of blast furnace gas from the crude steel production to the adjacent power plants. The emissions associated with the combustion of the blast furnace gas should be attributed to the crude steel production here under DirEm*."
"h)"
"Please enter here the amounts of net measurable heat (e.g. steam) being imported to (e.g. from connected heat supplying installations) or exported from (e.g. heat recovery from the furnace and exported from the production process) the production process."
"For the emission factor (EF) of the heat, please consider the efficiency of the boiler. For example, if the EF of the fuel of which the heat is produced is 96 t CO2/TJ and the boiler efficiency is 90%, the EF to be reported here would be 96 divided by 90%."
"For the EF of heat produced in a CHP, please see the reference to the ""CHP Tool"" above."
"Where the EF of exported heat is not clearly defined (e.g. heat recovery from furnaces or from exothermic heat), the standard emission factor of the fuel most commonly used in the country and industrial sector, assuming a boiler efficiency of 90%, should be used."
"Heat recovered and NOT exported but used within the production process shall not be reported under exported heat."
"i)"
"Import and export of waste gases"
"Further to the waste gas related provisions described above under DirEm*, please provide there the net amounts of waste gases imported from other processes or installations and consumed in this production process, as well as any amounts of waste gases exported and consumed outside the production process."
"The emission factor of the waste gases will not impact the emissions attributed to this production process, due to the special rules for waste gases. Inputs there are therefore optional."
"j)"
"Please enter the total amount of electricity consumed within the system boundaries of the production process."
"Please enter the average emission factor of the electricity consumed using the methods below for determination of this factor."
"The emission factor of the electricity can be determined by the following methods:"
"CO2 emission factor based on specific default values  "
"CO2 emission factor based on alternative default value "
"CO2 emission factor based on reliable data demonstrated by the importer"
"CO2 emission factor based on actual CO2 emissions of the installation "
"Mix"
"Where the electricity is not predominantly obtained from one source or the EF determined by more than one of the above sources, the EF is determined as a mix of the methods above."
"k)"
"Electricity exported"
"This concerns special forms of electricity production being produced within the production process but exported outside the process. It concerns electricity produced via other forms than in gas turbines or via steam in turbines, but - for instance - via expansion of compressed gases in expansion turbines."
"Summary of products"
"Please find below the detailed guidance on how to complete the sheet ""Summary_Products""."
"Sheet ""Summary_Products"" will be crucial for the communication with the 'reporting declarant' as it contains the main information required in order to correctly fill in the 'CBAM report' for importing the goods into the European Union."
"The information provided there should be for each type of good imported into the EU. The type of goods should be listed as disaggregated as possible, i.e. splitting type of goods by their CN codes using as many digits as possible."
"All information provided (specific embedded emissions, carbon price due, etc.) shall relate to the same reference period as entered in sheet A, section 1."

"General aspects"
"The term 'specific' of all elements below is to be understood as being expressed per unit of good (usually tonnes) of the production process in consideration. "
"Example: a precursor has specific embedded emissions of 0,8 tonnes of CO2e per tonne. The 'mass share' is 0,3 tonnes of precursor consumed per tonne of production from the relevant 'production process'. Under the block of the relevant 'production process, the value for 'SEE' for this precursor will therefore be displayed as 0,24 tonnes CO2e per tonne."
"Mass share"
"This is the specific consumption of each precursor per unit of products produced by the relevant 'production process'."
"(Share of) Default value"
"This is relevant for purchased precursors and indicates whether the embedded direct emissions are determined based on default values (""TRUE"") or actual measurements (""FALSE""). For the whole process, this indicator will calculate the share of embedded emissions determined by default values."

"This is the published version 2.1.1 of the CBAM template, version of 13 December 2024."
"Whenever a value of zero is to be reported, it should be entered rather than keeping the cell empty. Values needed for calculations should always be entered (especially if zero, because some formulas don't give results as long as required cells are empty). If a cell is kept empty, the reporting declarant does not know if the value is zero, is irrelevant or unknown, or if making entries has been overlooked."
"Special care must be taken to ensure consistency of data with the units displayed."
"White fields with grey text indicate that an input in another field makes the input here irrelevant."

"For information, emissions from the following precursors are relevant for the embedded emissions of the types of aggregated goods listed above. Where those precursors are actually relevant for your production processes, please make sure those are also listed either as products in the table above (if produced within your installation) or under section 5 ""purchased precursors"" below (where produced in other installations). Please note that for some goods the same aggregated good category itself can be a relevant precursor (e.g. iron & steel products, aluminium products, mixed fertilisers)."
"Based on the list under (a), please list here only aggregated goods categories (G1, G2, etc.) for which you want to establish distinct ""production process"" and assign all aggregated goods categories and relevant precursors that will be covered by its system boundary. Where the selected ""production process"" only includes the one aggregated goods category selected, please select ""only direct production"" in column F."
"Example: If ""ammonia"" and ""nitric acid"" are both produced in your installation, you may either create a separate production process for each of these good types, or report them combined under 'nitric acid' under a 'bubble approach'. In the case of the latter, please select as of column F which other process you want to include under this 'bubble approach'. Note: the 'bubble approach' is only allowed if all ammonia produced is processed into nitric acid.

For instance, if only direct emissions are covered by a carbon pricing system, the share to be provided here would be exactly the share in the direct emissions of the total emissions."
"Please enter here the carbon price due per tonne of CO2e in the relevant currency. This value shall be the carbon price before application of any rebate such as free allocation or financial compensation. It shall furthermore exclude any carbon price due for any precursors outside the production process to avoid double counting."
"Please enter here the rebate per tonne of CO2e covered by the rebate in the relevant currency. Again, it shall exclude any rebate for any precursors outside the production process to avoid double counting."
"Because this sheet is provided in a database-like format covering all monitoring approaches, each monitored item is corresponding to one row, and each parameter to be monitored is corresponding to one column. The columns not applicable to a specific monitoring approach are greyed out."
"This block is used for entering all emissions monitored using a ""calculation-based approach"" (Implementing Act Annex III section B.3). "
"The activity data is the data on the amount of fuels or materials consumed or produced by a process as relevant for the calculation-based monitoring methodology, expressed as mass in tonnes (t), or for gases as volume in normal cubic metres (Nm?), as appropriate."
"The corresponding units in which the amounts above are provided. Please select tonnes (t) for mass of solid, liquid or gaseous materials and fuels, or 1000 normal cubic metres (Nm?) for gases."
"The net calorific value is the specific amount of energy released as heat when a fuel or material undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions less the heat of vaporisation of any water formed."
"The input of NCV is mandatory for combustion emissions in order for the emission calculation to give meaningful results. However, in exceptional cases (where the emission factor is available as tCO2/t or tCO2/1000Nm3, the NCV is not taken into account for emission calculation, but only for the calculation of energy input."
"For process emissions, the NCV can be entered for fuels used as process material. In this case, the unit for the emission factor must be chosen as ""tCO2/TJ"". Otherwise the NCV is ignored in the calculation of emissions."
"For mass balances, the NCV can be entered for informative purposes, but it is not used for emission calculation."
"The appropriate unit for the NCV is automatically displayed based on the selection of the AD unit. Note, however, that in accordance with what has been said on the NCV above, in case of process emissions, the unit of the NCV will only be displayed if the unit for the EF is selected to be tCO2/TJ."
"The emission factor is used to calculate emissions under the ""standard methodology"" (section B.3.1 of Annex III of the implementing Act), but not for the mass balance approach. For biomass and mixed materials, the ""preliminary"" emission factor must be used. This is the assumed total emission factor of a mixed fuel or material based on the total carbon content composed of biomass fraction and fossil fraction before multiplying it with the fossil fraction to result in the emission factor."
"Please select here either ""tCO2/TJ"" (default for fuels), or ""tCO2/t"" or ""tCO2/1000Nm3"" if the NCV is not to be used for the calculation of emissions. The latter applies to process emissions or in exceptional cases to fuels, if the determination of NCV is not possible without incurring unreasonable costs."
"The carbon content of the fuel or material. This parameter is used only for the mass balance approach (Section B.3.2 of Annex III of the implementing act)."
"Depending on the selected unit for the activity data, the correct unit for the carbon content (either ""tC/t material"", or ""tC/1000Nm3"" for gases) is automatically displayed. "
"In order for the emission calculation to work properly, a standard value of 100% is used if the field is left empty. Note that the unit is fixed to percent (see next point). Therefore, the value entered here must be between 100 (full oxidation) and 0 (no oxidation at all)."
"Due to the way how Excel handles percentage values, only numbers WITHOUT percentage sign (""%"") must be entered."
"The unit of the oxidation factor is always percent (%)."
"In order for the emission calculation to work properly, a standard value of 100% is used if the field is left empty. Note that the unit is fixed to percent (see next point). Therefore, the value entered here must be between 100 (full yield of the process) and 0 (no reaction at all)."
"The unit of the conversion factor is always percent (%)."
"The entry of a biomass fraction is voluntary. If there is no biomass fraction, or if 0 is entered, the emission calculation gives automatically the result of a purely fossil fuel or material. Note that the unit is fixed to percent (see next point). Therefore, any value entered here must be between 100 (pure biomass) and 0 (no biomass at all)."
"The unit of the biomass fraction is always percent (%)."
"On the far right side of each block the total energy content and GHG emissions (fossil and biogenic) are calculated automatically for each source stream."
"If the units of activity data and emission factor are inconsistent, the message ""Inconsistent!"" is displayed. If the inputs are incomplete, the message ""Incomplete!"" is shown."

"Further columns which are relevant for calculation-based approaches only are greyed out in this table. Please scroll to the right until you reach columns relevant for CEMS."
"The biomass fraction is the ratio of carbon stemming from biomass to the total carbon content of a fuel or material, expressed as percentage. In case of CEMS, it is the ratio of carbon stemming from biomass to the total carbon contained in the flue gas."
"The entry of a biomass fraction is voluntary. If there is no biomass fraction, or if 0 is entered, the emission calculation gives automatically the result of purely fossil emissions. for N2O emissions, no biomass is irrelevant. Note that the unit is fixed to percent (see next point). Therefore, any value entered here must be between 100 (pure biomass) and 0 (no biomass at all)."
"The weighted average hourly concentration of the GHG measured."
"The unit in which the hourly average concentration is to be entered in this table. It is always set to g/Nm?."
"The total hours of operation of the continuous emission measurement during the reporting period."

"The unit in which the flue gas flow is to be entered in this table. It is always set to 1000Nm3/h."
"The total quantity (mass) of the GHG monitored using CEMS in the reporting period."
"The unit in which the mass of GHG emitted is calculated in this table. It is always set to tonnes."
"The GWP (global warming potential) of the GHG monitored."
"The energy content of the fuels or materials entering the production process during the reporting period. In case of CEMS this cannot be automatically determined but needs to be input by the user."
"Emissions (tCO2e)"
"In sheet ""D_Processes"" the required data inputs are necessary to calculate the emissions attributed to each production process, based on which the specific embedded emissions of the goods category are calculated in this template."
"General information on each production process"
"This block is used to input production amounts (""Activity levels"") of each production process, and to provide the material balance in case goods produced in the installation are used as precursors in other production processes within the installation."
"Note: According to the current text of Section A.4, point (b) of Annex III of the Implementing act, separate production processes must be defined where separate production routes are used for the same aggregated goods category."
"Because production processes can be defined in sheet ""A_InstData"" in a very flexible way, it is not possible to automatically select the appropriate production route here. Please enter zero for routes that do not apply in your installation's situation."
"Under point ii. the share put on the market is displayed for control purposes. Furthermore point iii. tells you if this is the complete amount (100%) of product. If it is 100%, the next section (consumed within the installation) is not relevant."
"Please provide here the total amount of goods that are consumed in each listed production process as input to be further processed into the goods produced in those processes. Please do not leave any yellow cells empty. Enter zero (""0"") if the good is not consumed by the specific process. Where all of the goods are reported as placed on the market under point b), this section will be greyed out and no inputs are required here."
"Please provide here the total amount of goods that are consumed in production processes within the installation which produce goods that are not covered by the scope of the CBAM. Do not leave empty, but enter 0 if applicable."
"This block is used for entering parameters necessary to calculate attributed emissions of the production process in accordance with the Implementing Act, Annex III section F.1."
"Waste gases are particularly relevant in integrated iron & steel production. They are flue gases containing high concentrations of incompletely oxidised carbon, for example, any coke oven gas imported into the blast furnace, or blast furnace gas exported from the production process to produce electricity."
"Please enter here the amount of direct emissions of the production process within the reporting period. Include all emissions directly linked to and therefore attributable to the production process taking into consideration the further provisions below."
"Emissions shall only be attributed to ONE production process reported for this installation. Values entered here must therefore NOT include any emissions linked to the production of the precursors that defined as another 'production process'. Otherwise the template would double-count the embedded emissions."
"Measureable heat (e.g. steam): Emissions associated with fuel input into boilers can be either included here as DirEm* or via the 'import of measurable heat' below, but must not be reported twice."
"If a boiler or CHP supplies heat to several production processes or other installations, the approach to report ""imported heat"" is preferred. If the heat is produced in a CHP, the emissions have to be split between heat and electricity. The CHP Tool can help in calculating this split."
"Please enter here the amounts of net measurable heat (e.g. steam) being imported to (e.g. from connected heat supplying installations) or exported from the production process (e.g. heat recovery from the furnace and exported from the production process)."
"For the emission factor (EF) of the heat, please take into account the efficiency of the boiler. For example: The EF of the fuel from which the heat is produced is 96 t CO2/TJ; the boiler efficiency is 90%. Therefore, the EF to be reported here would be 96 divided by 90% = 106.67 t CO2/TJ."
"Where the EF of exported heat is unknown or not clearly defined (e.g. heat recovery from furnaces or from exothermic chemical processes), the standard emission factor of the fuel most commonly used in the country and industrial sector, assuming a boiler efficiency of 90%, should be used."
"Further to the waste gas related provisions described above under DirEm*, please provide here the net amounts of waste gases imported from other processes or installations and consumed in this production process, as well as any amounts of waste gases exported from and consumed outside the production process."
"The emission factor of the waste gases will not impact the emissions attributed to this production process, due to the special rules for waste gases. Their input here is therefore optional."
"Please enter the weighted average emission factor of the electricity consumed using one of the methods for determination of this factor listed below (referencing the applicable section in Annex III of the Implementing Act)."
"The EF of the electricity can be determined by the following methods:"
"EF based on IEA data, provided by the European Commission"
"EF based on other publicly available data representing either the average EF or the CO2 emission factor as in section 4.3 of Annex IV of the CBAM Regulation."
"EF of electricity produced in the installation other than by cogeneration"
"EF of electricity produced in the installation by cogeneration"
"EF of electricity produced outside the installation (received from a source with a direct technical link)"
"EF of electricity produced outside the installation (received from a producer under a power purchase agreement)"
"In sheet ""E_PurchPrec"" the required data inputs are necessary to calculate the embedded emissions of the goods produced in the installation using purchased precursors. The sheet serves for listing the information required in line with section E of Annex III of the Implementing Act."
"Please provide here the total amount of purchased precursor consumed in the reporting period, distinguishing amounts by the relevant production route by which the precursor was produced, if known. "
"Under this point, please provide information how much of the precursor has been consumed during the reporting period in each production process within the installation."
"For completeness of data, please enter here the amount of the precursor not used for the production of CBAM goods within the installation. This includes transfer to other installations or sale of the precursor."
"This is an automatic calculation ""a-(b+c)"". Please ensure that this value is zero."
"Please enter here the values obtained from the supplier of the precursor, and the data source given by the supplier."
"As information source you may choose whether the producer has determined (measured) the data, or whether the default value provided by the European Commission was used."
"Please enter the specific direct embedded emissions, i.e. the embedded emissions value per tonne of precursor. If obtained from the supplier, use the most recent available data. Values are to be expressed as tCO2e per tonne precursor, i.e. covering all greenhouse gases relevant."
"Please enter the value for the electricity consumption per tonne of precursor. If obtained from the supplier, use the most recent available data."
"Please enter the applicable emission factor (EF) for electricity used for the production of the precursor. The following options can be chosen as data source:"
"The specific embedded indirect emissions are calculated by the template as electricity consumed times the emission factor."
"If you used default values for at least one parameter, you have to provide a justification for the use of the default value. Please select one from the drop-down list."
"Information should be provided for each type of good imported into the EU. The type of goods should be listed as disaggregated as possible, i.e. splitting type of goods by their CN codes using as many digits as possible."
"The full text name of the selected CN category will be displayed here automatically after selecting the CN code."
"Data related to the specific embedded emissions (SEE, direct/indirect/total) will be displayed automatically based on entries in previous sheets, including the embedded electricity and the source based on which the emission factor (EF) of the electricity consumption is determined."
"The unit for all SEE values is t CO2e per tonne of product. For electricity as product SEE is in the unit of t CO2e per MWh."
"The source of the emission factor for electricity. The following options (based on the related sections of Annex III of the Implementing Act) are available:"
"Specific embedded electricity consumption of the production process, i.e. including any embedded electricity consumption in other production processes within the installation and purchased precursors."
"For steel goods, the identification number of the specific steel mill (also known as the ""heat number"") where a particular batch of raw materials was produced, where known. Information provided here may just refer to the parts of this number identifying the steel mill, not the individual batches as well."
"This parameter is relevant for the production of cement. Please provide here the clinker factor (i.e. clinker to cement ratio), expressed as mass % of clinker content in the cement."
"This parameter is relevant for the production of ammonia. Please provide here the concentration of ammonia, if in hydrous solution, expressed as %, or enter 100% for pure/anhydrous ammonia."
"General note:"
"Based on your input on the share of embedded emissions covered by a carbon price, the related part of the specific embedded emissions of the good are displayed here in t CO2e per tonne product (or per MWh electricity)."
"Please select the code for the applicable currency in which the carbon price is being due. The next column displays the full name of the currency."
"Please enter here the carbon price due per tonne or MWh (as applicable) of product in the relevant currency. This value shall not include any rebate such as free allocation or financial compensation. Where the tool in sheet F was used, values should equal results displayed in column L there."
"Based on your input on the share of embedded emissions covered by a carbon price rebate, the related part of the specific embedded emissions of the good are displayed here in t CO2e per tonne product (or per MWh electricity)."
"Please enter here the rebate per tonne or MWh (as applicable) of product covered by the rebate in the relevant currency. Where the tool in sheet F was used, values should equal results displayed in column M there."
