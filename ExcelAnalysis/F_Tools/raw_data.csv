,,,,"This is a tool for attributing fuels and emissions of CHPs to heat and electricity output.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This tool exists twofold in this template and each tool should only be used for one CHP. If more CHPs are relevant, you must aggregate energy amounts and emissions from multiple CHPs, as appropriate, or perform separate calculations using additional copies of this template.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Periods during which the CHP is operated in heat-only or electricity-only generation mode (i.e. periods during which only one of the two products was produced) should be excluded and assignment of fuels and emissions should be calculated separately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,"This tool aims to help you with the calculation of the carbon price due. Similar to the calculation of the specific embedded emissions in sheets D + E, please only enter the carbon price due and any rebate received in respect of the system boundaries of the production process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The results obtained here in columns L and M have to be manually entered into the respective fields in sheet ""Summary_Products"", columns AR and AX, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The following conditions apply:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,"- the carbon price used for each production process has to be converted into one common currency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,"- the system boundaries of carbon pricing have to be consistent with the boundaries of the production process and precursors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"If the conditions above are not satisfied, this tool can only be used to support you with the calculation of the carbon price, but results cannot be used directly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Share of emissions covered by the carbon price","Please enter here the share of the TOTAL (direct + indirect) specific emissions that are subject to carbon pricing. For instance, if only direct emissions are covered by a carbon pricing system, the share to be provided here would be exactly the share in the direct emissions of the total emissions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Carbon price (CP) due (local currency)","Please enter here the carbon price due per tonne of CO2e in the relevant currency. This value shall be the carbon price before application of any rebate such as free allocation or financial compensation. It shall furthermore exclude any carbon price due for any precursors outside the production process to avoid double counting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
