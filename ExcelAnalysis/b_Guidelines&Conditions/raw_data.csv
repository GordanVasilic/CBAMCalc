,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"1","Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes a carbon border adjustment mechanism (the ?CBAM Regulation?) to address greenhouse gas emissions embedded in certain goods ('CBAM goods': iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, hydrogen and electricity) on their importation into the customs territory of the European Union (the EU). The Regulation can be downloaded from:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/956/oj",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"2","Pursuant to Article 35(7) of the CBAM Regulation, the Commission adopted an implementing act (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 of 17 August 2023) which lays down the detailed rules for 'reporting declarants' (as defined in Article 2(1) of this implementing act) for reporting obligations upon import into the European Union during the transitional period from 1 October 2023 to 31 December 2025 (?transitional period?). The Regulation can be downloaded from:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2023/1773/oj",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"3","Article 8 of the implementing act requires reporting declarants to submit a CBAM report for each good listed under 1. imported into the EU. CBAM reports must contain certain data and information on the embedded emissions of the goods, to be obtained from the producer of these goods ('operators of installations located in third countries').",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"4","This data collection template has been developed on behalf of the Commission by its consultants (Umweltbundesamt GmbH Austria) and serves the purpose of facilitating the communication between operators of installations located in third countries and the reporting declarants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"The views expressed in this file represent the views of the authors and not necessarily those of the European Commission. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"5","This is the published version 2.1.1 of the CBAM template, version of 13 December 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"2",,"How to use this file",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"How to use this file",,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"6","Automatic calculation (to be found in the menu Formula/Calculation options) must be turned on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"It is recommended that you go through the file from start to end. There are a few functions which will guide you through the form which depend on previous input, such as cells changing colour if an input is not needed (see colour codes below).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"7","Whenever a value of zero is to be reported, it should be entered rather than keeping the cell empty. Values needed for calculations should always be entered (especially if zero, because some formulas don't give results as long as required cells are empty). If a cell is kept empty, the reporting declarant does not know if the value is zero, is irrelevant or unknown, or if making entries has been overlooked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"8","In several fields you can choose from predefined inputs using a ""drop-down list"", by either clicking on the small arrow appearing at the right border of the cell, or pressing ""Alt-CursorDown"" when you have selected the cell. Also, there are some fields which enable you to draft your reply even if a drop-down list exists. This is the case when drop-down lists contain empty list entries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"9","Error messages will occur sometimes when data entries are incomplete. However, the non-appearance of error messages is not a guarantee for correct calculations, as a data completeness test is not always possible. If no result appears in a green field, it can be assumed that some data is still missing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Special care must be taken to ensure consistency of data with the units displayed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"10","Colour codes and fonts:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"Black bold text:",,"This is text describing the input required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"Smaller italic text:",,"This text gives further explanations. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,"Yellow fields indicate mandatory inputs for the calculation of embedded emissions and for other information required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,"Light yellow fields indicate that an input is optional.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,"Green fields show automatically calculated results. Red text indicates error messages (missing data etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"n.a.",,"White fields with grey text indicate that an input in another field makes the input here irrelevant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,"Light grey areas are dedicated for navigation and hyperlinks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"Additionally, there are colour indicators in some sheets (e.g. in column O of sheets D, E; column B in sheet Summary_Products) indicating the following:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"White indicates that data entry is not required here, based on entries in another field making inputs here irrelevant (see 'shaded fields' above).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Red colour indicates data inputs are required but the relevant cells are empty or filled incorrectly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Green colour indicates data inputs are required and cells have been filled correctly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"11","Navigation panels on top of each sheet provide hyperlinks for quick jumps to individual input sections. The first line (""Table of contents"", ""Further guidance"", ""Summary_Processes"" and ""Summary_Products"") is the same for all sheets. Depending on the sheet, further menu items are added. If the background colour of one of the hyperlink areas turns red, this indicates that data is missing in the related section (not in all sheets).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"12","This template has been locked against data entry except for (light) yellow fields. However, for transparency reasons, no password has been set. This allows for complete viewing of all formulae. When using this file for data entry, it is recommended to keep the protection in force. The sheets should only be unprotected for checking the validity of formulae. It is recommended to do this in a separate file.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"13","In order to protect formulae against unintended modifications, which usually lead to wrong and misleading results, it is of utmost importance NOT TO USE the CUT & PASTE feature. If you want to move data, first COPY and PASTE them, and thereafter delete the unwanted data in the old (wrong) place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"14","DISCLAIMER: All formulae have been developed carefully and thoroughly. However, mistakes cannot be fully excluded.
As described above, full transparency for checking the validity of calculations is ensured. Neither the authors of this file nor the European Commission can be held liable for eventual damages resulting from wrong or misleading results of the provided calculations. 
It is the full responsibility of the user of this file (i.e. the operator of an installation) to ensure that reporting declarants report accurate data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
