"79","5","Example: If ""ammonia"" and ""nitric acid"" are both produced in your installation, you may either create a separate production process for each of these good types, or report them combined under 'nitric acid' under a 'bubble approach'. In the case of the latter, please select as of column F which other process you want to include under this 'bubble approach'. Note: the 'bubble approach' is only allowed if all ammonia produced is processed into nitric acid. If parts of the ammonia are exported from the installation, two separate production processes have to be entered here."
